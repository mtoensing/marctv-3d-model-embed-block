Show interactive 3D models in WordPress with a simple block for GLB and glTF files, including optional zoom controls.

== Description ==

Adds a block for interactive 3D models in `.glb` and `.gltf` format from the media library.
You can keep interaction limited to horizontal rotation or enable zoom explicitly when needed.

This plugin is being developed on GitHub https://github.com/mtoensing/marctv-3d-model-embed-block

Includes the `model-viewer` runtime locally:

* Project: https://modelviewer.dev/
* Source: https://github.com/google/model-viewer
* Package: `@google/model-viewer`
* Version: `4.2.0`
* Bundled file: `public/vendor/model-viewer/4.2.0/model-viewer-umd.min.js`
* License: Apache License 2.0

The bundled file is kept versioned in the plugin and documented alongside the asset.

== Source Code and Build Instructions ==

The generated block assets in `build/` are compiled from the human-readable source files in the public development repository:

* Repository: https://github.com/mtoensing/marctv-3d-model-embed-block
* Block source: `src/`
* Build tooling: `package.json`
* Build command: `npm install` followed by `npm run build`

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Upload a `.glb` or `.gltf` file to the media library.
3. Insert the `3D Model Embed Block` block and select the file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which file formats are supported? =

The block supports 3D models in `.glb` and `.gltf`.

= Can I enter an external model URL? =

Yes. Use the block's URL input to insert a `.glb` or `.gltf` file directly.

= Can I enable zoom? =

Yes. Turn on `Zoom interaction` in the block sidebar to enable pinch zoom on touch devices and mouse-wheel zoom on desktop.
